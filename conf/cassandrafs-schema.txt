/*
	The chunks will be stored in one column. So the convention with the multiple rows and _$x will be kept. This will happen to make use of 
	the benefits of the compression. Thus we keep only one column.
	
	*------- OLDE ------*
	File chunks will be stored in the same row but in different columns. Since compation nowadays doesn't loads the entire row in memory
	we are free to load it as much as needed. Hipothetically having the restriction that a column value can't be more than 2GB and the 
	maximum number of columns per row is 2 billion...means we have plenty of room to store a single file.
	*-------------------*
	
	Each row key exists in FileMeta will exist in FileData with all the appropriate columns.
	
	Also it is stored in a different column family because FileMeta CF has all the default columns making it more robust for the use of
	the sstable compression.
	
	Future ---- a new column family can be added to hold all the relations.
